#
#	Note:	The order of the definition of dungeons in this file
#		reflects in their order of creation in the real dungeon.
#		The "Main" branch must *always* be first.
#		Also note that the order of the dungeons in this file
#		determines the order in which branch levels are assigned.
#		If two dungeons have overlapping ranges for their entry
#		points, then you should list the dungeon with the _least_
#		number of choices for its branch level _first_.

#
#	Gehennom
#
#	Now re-worked for 3.1, hell is hopefully going to be a little
#	less boring.  Also, in 3.1, the tower is not considered as a
#	part of hell, but is set up as a separate dungeon.
#
#	Gehennom is no longer considered "hellish" as a complete dungeon.
#	That is, fire resistance is no longer a condition for survival in
#	it.  However, Gehennom, and the special levels in it in particular,
#	is abundant with fire traps.  As a result, fire resistance is still
#	a prudent survival strategy in Gehennom.
#
#	Note:	Gehennom *must* be the second dungeon defined so that
#		monsters can properly migrate here under certain
#		circumstances.
